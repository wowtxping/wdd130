            <p>Hello, my name is Tao Ping. Originally from China, I have spent over five years living and working in Cambodia.
                My major is Software Development. Even though I don't want to be a programmer, I chose it because I believe its 
                skills are essential for navigating the complexities of modern life. It's me and my girlfriend in the photoüòÅ. 
                I look forward to studying with you!</p>
